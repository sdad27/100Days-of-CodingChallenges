//Q10- Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
// describing what the program does.
// my name is saeed
// dob : 24 june
// this program is simple like hello world
console.log("this is just a simple program thanks");
