// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. 
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object 
// containing these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing 
// different albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. 
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

function make_album(album : {artist:string,title:string,track?:number}) {
    return album;
}
console.log(make_album({artist:"artist1",title:"album1"}));
console.log(make_album({artist:"artist2",title:"album2"}));
console.log(make_album({artist:"artist3",title:"album3",track:8}));
