// Explain the concept of the event loop in JavaScript with an example.

// Explain & TIP: The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, enabling asynchronous operations. 
// It monitors the call stack and the callback queue. If the call stack is empty, it moves the first event 
// from the queue to the stack, ensuring non-blocking execution.

console.log("start");

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("callback executed");
    
},0)
console.log("end");
