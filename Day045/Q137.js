// Implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors in a block of code.
// Explain & TIP: The try-catch statement marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response, 
// should an exception be thrown. It's a critical feature for robust error handling in JavaScript.
try {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}
catch (error) {
    // console.log(error.message); comment this line due to error according to given statement
}
export {};
