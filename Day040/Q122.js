// Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1 and breaks the loop when it reaches 5.
// Explain & TIP: The break statement terminates the loop immediately. This is useful for stopping a loop 
// when a certain condition is met, even if the loop's original termination condition hasn't been reached yet.
